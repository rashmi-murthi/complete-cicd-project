### Step 1: Identify Dependencies on the Subnets

✅ Go to VPC → Subnets:

- Find subnet-00488b23d9601f63e and subnet-086567a5bda58cf79.

- Click on each subnet → Resources tab → Check what is still using it.

Look for:

- ENIs (Network Interfaces) → Delete them.

- EC2 Instances → Terminate them.

### Step 2: Delete Dependent Resources

Go to Load Balancers

It should now delete the VPC and finish successfully.

Step 4: Verify Cleanup

Ensure the VPC no longer exists under VPC → Your VPCs.

Ensure no leftover ENIs, route tables, subnets, or security groups are present.
